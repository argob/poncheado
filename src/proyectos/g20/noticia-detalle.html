                    <p>Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. (Bedroom - 1:00 am) (Marty's asleep in his clothes. The phone rings, and Marty wakes up and answers it.) Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you?</p>

Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you? 300 bucks? (He gets out of the car.) 300 bucks for a couple of dents? No, hey, that's bullshit Terry. No Biff, it was horseshit, the whole car was filled with it. (We cut to 2015 Biff as he remembers this.) (v.o) I had to pay Old Man Jones 80 bucks to haul it away! (v.o) Old Man Jones? He probably resold it too! Now I ought to get something for that.</p>

                    <p class="destacadoNoticia m-y-2">Marty, what are you doing, saying you're going to meet Tannen? Doc, don't worry about it! Monday morning, 8 AM. We're gonna be gone, right?</p>

                    <p>No it can't be you...I just sent you back to the future! I know, you did send me back to the future, but I'm back! I'm back from the future! Great Scott! (He faints.) Doc. C'mon. Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. (George looks down and Biff smacks his head.) Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. (Goes to the fridge to get a beer.) I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead? Say hi to your mom for me. (leaves) (turns to see Marty's disappointed expression) I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations. The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry. (Dinner Table - Later)</p>
